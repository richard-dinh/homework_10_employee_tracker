# homework_10_employee_tracker

For this assignment, I created a Content Managment System (CMS) utilizing mysql2 for a database and inqurier to get user input. This app gives the manager the capabilities to track their employee information: name, title, department, salary. Managers are also able to edit employee information, add new employees, and remove employees.

Technologies Used:
mysql2 npm
inquirer npm
Nodejs
